# Crowdfunding_ETL

Scenario:
Within this Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) mini project, our group of four has practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform Crowdfunding and Contacts data. After the data has been transformed, the data is exported into four CSV files and used to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, the CSV file data is imported into a Postgres database.
